Summary
-------

The 'sync' extension introduces synchonization objects into PHP.  Named and unnamed Mutex, Semaphore, Event, and Reader-Writer objects provide OS-level synchronization on both *NIX (POSIX semaphores required) and Windows platforms.  The extension comes with a test suite that integrates cleanly into 'make test'.

This extension uses the liberal MIT open source license.  And, of course, it sits on GitHub for all of that pull request and issue tracker goodness to easily submit changes and ideas respectively.

Details
-------

An exception may be thrown from the constructors if the target object can't be created for some reason.

All synchronization objects are attempted to be unlocked cleanly within PHP itself.  The exception is if an object's $autounlock option is initialized to false.  If PHP terminates a script and doesn't unlock the object, it can leave the object in an unpredictable state.

NOTE:  When using "named" objects, the initialization must be identical for a given name and have a specific purpose.  Reusing named objects for other purposes is not a good idea and will probably result in breaking both applications.  However, different object types can share the same name (e.g. a Mutex and an Event object can have the same name).

```
void SyncMutex::__construct([string $name = null])
  Constructs a named or unnamed mutex object.

bool SyncMutex::lock([int $wait = -1])
  Locks a mutex object.  $wait is in milliseconds.

bool SyncMutex::unlock([bool $all = false])
  Unlocks a mutex object.


void SyncSemaphore::__construct([string $name = null, [int $initialval = 1, [bool $autounlock = true]]])
  Constructs a named or unnamed semaphore object.  Don't set $autounlock to false unless you really know what you are doing.

bool SyncSemaphore::lock([int $wait = -1])
  Locks a semaphore object.  $wait is in milliseconds.

bool SyncSemaphore::unlock([int &$prevcount])
  Unlocks a semaphore object.


void SyncEvent::__construct([string $name = null, [bool $manual = false]])
  Constructs a named or unnamed event object.

bool SyncEvent::wait([int $wait = -1])
  Waits for an event object to fire.  $wait is in milliseconds.

bool SyncEvent::fire()
  Lets a thread through that is waiting.  Lets multiple threads through that are waiting if the event object is 'manual'.

bool SyncEvent::reset()
  Resets the event object state.  Only use when the event object is 'manual'.


void SyncReaderWriter::__construct([string $name = null, [bool $autounlock = true]])
  Constructs a named or unnamed reader-writer object.  Don't set $autounlock to false unless you really know what you are doing.

bool SyncReaderWriter::readlock([int $wait = -1])
  Read locks a reader-writer object.  $wait is in milliseconds.

bool SyncReaderWriter::writelock([int $wait = -1])
  Write locks a reader-writer object.  $wait is in milliseconds.

bool SyncReaderWriter::readunlock()
  Read unlocks a reader-writer object.

bool SyncReaderWriter::writeunlock()
  Write unlocks a reader-writer object.
```

Usage Examples
--------------

Example Mutex usage:

```php
$mutex = new SyncMutex();

$mutex->lock();
...
$mutex->unlock();


$mutex2 = new SyncMutex("UniqueName");

if (!$mutex2->lock(3000))
{
	echo "Unable to lock mutex.";

	exit();
}

...

$mutex2->unlock();
```

Example Semaphore usage:

```php
$semaphore = new SyncSemaphore("LimitedResource_2clients", 2);

if (!$semaphore->lock(3000))
{
	echo "Unable to lock semaphore.";

	exit();
}

...

$semaphore->unlock();
```

Example Event usage:

```php
// In a web application:
$event = new SyncEvent("GetAppReport");
$event->fire();

// In a cron job:
$event = new SyncEvent("GetAppReport");
$event->wait();
```

Example Reader-Writer usage:

```php
$readwrite = new SyncReaderWriter("FileCacheLock");
$readwrite->readlock();
...
$readwrite->readunlock();

$readwrite->writelock();
...
$readwrite->writeunlock();
```
